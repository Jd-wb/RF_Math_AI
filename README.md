# RF_Math_AI
a reinforced math AI currently in development It's able to do simple math maybe some big multiplication questions but im trying to develop it better 

this is a passion project im doing by myself currently while in school

How to use this crappy calculator

*"THIS REQUIRES A TERMINAL"*

I use python 3.12 and Vsc (Visual Studio code)

you just input your question in the terminal and it should answer accordingly I think, it kinda sucks
